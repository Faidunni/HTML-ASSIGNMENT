        <h2>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
        <p>
          Hmm, let's say, I am a girl of so many talents, I can be a writer
          today and a mechanic tomorrow. I am a very spontaneous person,
          although I constantly fight between being an introvert and an
          extrovert, so I don't really know how that fix with someone that
          claims to be spontaneous. I am a very fun peron to be around "well
          when I have eaten" and my favorite food is <b>bread</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite quote that I go by everyday is
          <b>"it pays to be lazy, try it sometimes"</b>. I am not much of a
          reader but a listener, I love listening to podcast and audiobooks.
